about to introduce fruit gift box, which is a great gift for birthday or to wish someone a fast recovery. You are very confident that this fruit gift box will be a great success and want to introduce it immediately without advertising. <br>\nYour business partner, Bambang sees it differently and he suggests launching an advertising campaign. The advertising campaign will cost RM 500 and if successful will produce RM 5,000 revenue. If the campaign is unsuccessful (which there is a 25% chance it would), the revenue is estimated at only RM 1,000. If no advertising is used, the revenue is estimated at RM 3,000 with probability of 0.7 if customers are receptive to this fruit gift box and RM 1,000 with probability of 0.3 if they are not. <br>\nIf no advertising is used, you are thinking to ask Katie to conduct a market survey. The survey cost is RM 250. The survey will be positive or negative, indicating either a good or poor response from customers. Past experiences suggested that the probability of positive is 0.7. The probabilities when no advertising is used will then be revised based on whether the survey is positive or negative. If the survey is positive, the probability that a customer is receptive to this fruit gift box is 0.85. If the survey is negative, the probability that a customer is receptive to this fruit gift box is 0.45.\n\n<br>\n\nüëâ **Solution:** <br>\nBased on the scenario above, the decision tree in `yaml` file will be as follows:\n```\nname: Florist Gift Box\ntype: decision\nAdvertisement:\n    type: chance\n    Success:\n        type: terminal\n        p: 0.75\n        payoff: 4500\n    Not success:\n        type: terminal\n        p: 0.25\n        payoff: 500\nMarket survey:\n    type: chance\n    Positive:\n        type: chance\n        p: 0.7\n        Receptive:\n            type: terminal\n            p: 0.85\n            payoff: 2750\n        Not Receptive:\n            type: terminal\n            p: 0.15\n            payoff: 750\n    Negative:\n        type: chance\n        p: 0.3\n        Receptive:\n            type: terminal\n            p: 0.45\n            payoff: 2750\n        Not Receptive:\n            type: terminal\n            p: 0.55\n            payoff: 750\n```\nüëâ Now let's construct the decision tree in R.\n","metadata":{"id":"emO_2YKKUKtR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fileName <- '../input/yaml-file/Florist Gift Box.yaml'\nl <- yaml.load_file(fileName)\njl <- as.Node(l)\nprint(jl, \"type\", \"payoff\", \"p\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.251828Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.253279Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.288086Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"payoff <- function(node) {\n  if (node$type == 'chance') node$payoff <- sum(sapply(node$children, function(child) child$payoff * child$p))\n  else if (node$type == 'decision') node$payoff <- max(sapply(node$children, function(child) child$payoff))\n}\n\njl$Do(payoff, traversal = \"post-order\", filterFun = isNotLeaf)\n\ndecision <- function(x) {\n  po <- sapply(x$children, function(child) child$payoff)\n  x$decision <- names(po[po == x$payoff])\n}\n\njl$Do(decision, filterFun = function(x) x$type == 'decision')\n\nGetNodeLabel <- function(node) switch(node$type, \n                                      terminal = paste0( 'RM ', format(node$payoff, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = \",\")),\n                                      paste0('EV/n', 'RM ', format(node$payoff, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = \",\")))\n\nGetEdgeLabel <- function(node) {\n  if (!node$isRoot && node$parent$type == 'chance') {\n    label = paste0(node$name, \" (\", node$p, \")\")\n  } else {\n    label = node$name\n  }\n  return (label)\n}\n\nGetNodeShape <- function(node) switch(node$type, decision = \"box\", chance = \"circle\", terminal = \"none\")\n\n\nSetEdgeStyle(jl, fontname = 'helvetica', label = GetEdgeLabel)\nSetNodeStyle(jl, fontname = 'helvetica', label = GetNodeLabel, shape = GetNodeShape)\n\njl$Do(function(x) SetEdgeStyle(x, color = \"red\", inherit = FALSE), \n      filterFun = function(x) !x$isRoot && x$parent$type == \"decision\" && x$parent$decision == x$name)\n\nSetGraphStyle(jl, rankdir = \"LR\")","metadata":{"id":"pP-e8qCUUNVO","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.29071Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.292222Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.343454Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(jl, \"type\", \"payoff\", \"p\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.34617Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.347714Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.366868Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot(jl)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.369395Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-14T12:32:31.370879Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-14T12:32:32.135972Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"üëâ Based on the results of the decision tree compiled, it can be seen that the **EV for the use of advertisements is higher** than the EV of the market survey. <br>\nüëâ The **EV obtained for advertisement is RM 3,500, while the EV market survey is only RM 2,210**.
